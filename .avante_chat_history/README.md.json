This will reduce the size of the image while maintaining its aspect ratio. Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 3-3\n```markdown\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./assets/voxtral.png\" alt=\"Voxtral\" width=\"300\"></p>\n```\n\nThis change adds a width of 300 pixels to the image, which should make it smaller. You can adjust the width value as needed to achieve the desired size. The alignment and alt text remain unchanged, ensuring the image is still centered and accessible.", "request": "make this image smaller"}]
