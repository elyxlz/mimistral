We'll add this check at the beginning of the function. Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 132-137\n```python\ndef scrape_youtube_urls(config: ScrapingConfig) -> None:\n    print(\"Starting YouTube URL scraping process\")\n    \n    # Check if FFmpeg is installed\n    try:\n        subprocess.run([\"ffmpeg\", \"-version\"], check=True, capture_output=True)\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        print(\"Error: FFmpeg is not installed. Please install FFmpeg before running this script.\")\n        return\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"Error: FFmpeg is not found in the system PATH. Please install FFmpeg or add it to the PATH.\")\n        return\n\n    if not os.path.exists(config.output_path):\n        os.makedirs(config.output_path)\n        print(f\"Created output directory: {config.output_path}\")\n```\n\nThis modification adds a check for FFmpeg installation before proceeding with the scraping process. It attempts to run the `ffmpeg -version` command, which should work if FFmpeg is properly installed and accessible in the system PATH. If the command fails or FFmpeg is not found, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the function returns early, preventing the scraping process from starting.\n\nThis change is necessary to ensure that the script doesn't proceed with downloading and chunking videos if FFmpeg is not available, as FFmpeg is a critical dependency for the video processing tasks in this script.", "request": "add an assert before scraping starts that ffmpeg is installed"}]
